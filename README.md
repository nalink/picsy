# picsy
idea 
    1. save picture without user login/password
    2. picture can be saved/searched through some context or code
    3. Like - login/pwd are user's critical information, but code/context with phone number would replace that 

approach
    1. java would be used as backend server
    2. ios/andriod based technology for app UI
    3. mysql for db and redis for in-memory db
    4. github for project repository
    5. AWS S3 for content storage
